2) Once the "Get Started" button is selected they are taken to the "notes" home page. The user can type in a "Note Title" as well as "Note Text" below that. There is also a button in the corner that allows the user to restart their note if there is a mistake or they change their mind.

6) If the user wants they can select a previous note and see what it says. It will appear in the main panel when selected in lighter/locked lettering so to inform the user that it cannot be edited, however if they do select the red trash can beside the note....
